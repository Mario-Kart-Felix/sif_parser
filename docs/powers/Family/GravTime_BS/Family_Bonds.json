Temporal Mending will immediately heal its targets and continue to heal them for an equal amount over the next 6 seconds. Additionally, affected allies will gain some resistance to slow effects and regeneration debuffs. Allies affected by the Accelerated effect will receive additional healing from this power. Temporal Mending will apply a regeneration bonus instead of heal over time for a short while if the user is in a PvP zone. Recharge: Long",
