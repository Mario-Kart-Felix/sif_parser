  "display_help": "By carefully striking at their foes, Sentinels work towards creating opportunistic attacks that can weaken their foes or grant themselves a chance to recoup. Any enemy that a Sentinel focuses attacks on will be easier to hit and will suffer an additional 5% damage from incoming attacks. Multiple Sentinels can work together to make this effect stronger. Occasionally, the Sentinel may find an extreme vulnerability in a target that can be exploited to deliver up to 25% additional damage against it for a limited time. Only one such extreme vulnerability may be exploited at a time.",
