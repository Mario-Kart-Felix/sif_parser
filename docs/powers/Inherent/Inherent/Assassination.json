When properly 'Hidden\", a Stalker can pull off Critical hits with his attacks, and even land a massive 'Assassins Strike' with an Assassins power. Assassin Strikes made from hide will Demoralize the Stalker's foes leaving them with a reduced chance to hit and has a chance to terrorize them. Additionally, a Stalker has a 10 percent base chance to critically hit, which is increased by an additional 3 percent per member in your party, against non-player enemies. Stalkers have a chance to land a critical hit against players if they are Held or Slept. Each of the Stalker's damaging powers within their primary power set, other than Assassin's Strike, have a chance to grant the Stalker a stack of Assassin's Focus. Each stack of this buff boosts Assassin's Strike's chance to critically (hit while the user is not hidden) by 33.3%. Assassin's Focus stacks up to 3 times.",
