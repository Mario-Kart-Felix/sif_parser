When neither is engaged, the HAC uses standard modifiers, which favor Buff, Debuff and Movement powers. If the Offense Mode toggle is engaged, then the focus shifts, becoming weaker to Buff, Debuff and Movement values, but Recharge, To Hit and Damage are increased. In Defensive Mode, the ATmods shift, becoming weaker to Buff, Debuff and Movement values, but stronger to Damage Resistances, Status changes and Regeneration. HAC's are harder to heal and are vulnerable to Electro-Magnetic effects.",
