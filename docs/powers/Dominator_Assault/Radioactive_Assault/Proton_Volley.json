This is a sniper attack, and is best fired from a distance as it can be interrupted. If you are engaged in battle this attack becomes instant-cast. If you are not engaged, it will do bonus damage. Affected enemies have a small chance to be affected by the Contaminated effect. Hitting Contaminated foes with single target Radioactive Assault powers cause a small burst of damage to foes near the target. Damage: Superior, Recharge: Slow",
