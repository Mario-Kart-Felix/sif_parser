In primal (human) form you will deal smashing damage and will heal yourself and up to 3 nearby allies for a moderate amount of health. In Hunter form you'll deal lethal damage and significantly reduce the target's damage. In Prowler form you'll deal lethal damage, cause moderate lethal damage over time and stun the target.
