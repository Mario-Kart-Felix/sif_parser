This power is slower than Pistols, but deals more damage, and the target may get knocked down by the force of the impact.

Additionally, changing your ammunition type will also change the secondary effect of this attack from Knockback to a minor attack speed and movement speed debuff if 'Cryo Ammo' is loaded, a minor damage over time effect if 'Incendiary Ammo' is loaded, or a -damage effect if 'Chemical Ammo' is loaded.",
