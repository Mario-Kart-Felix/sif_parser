  "display_help": "You overcharge your beam rifle, releasing the accumulated power in a massive blast of energy targeted at your foes. This blast erupts on hitting the target, causing energy damage and significantly lowering the defenses of all foes caught in the burst. There is also a lingering damage over time effect, but this is much less powerful than the initial burst. Additionally, there is a strong chance that affected targets will be stunned.",
