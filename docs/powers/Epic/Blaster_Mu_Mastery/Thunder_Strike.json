The Mu pulse with the blood of their slaughtered ancestors in their veins, and are well practiced in the dark arts. Your access to this Adept is very limited. You can only summon him once every 15 minutes and he will leave after 4 minutes, or if you exit a zone or mission. You must be level 41 and have either Static Discharge or Charged Armor before selecting this power. Recharge: Extremely Long",
