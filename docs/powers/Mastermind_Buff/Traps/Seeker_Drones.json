The small explosive flash of energy does only minor damage, but the concussion can weaken foes. Affected targets will have reduced Damage, chance to hit and Perception and may even be Disoriented for a short while. You can only ever have Two Seeker Drones out at one time and they can be destroyed by your foes. Recharge: Long",
