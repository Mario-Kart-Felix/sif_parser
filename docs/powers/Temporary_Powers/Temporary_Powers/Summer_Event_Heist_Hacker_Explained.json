This OS has defaulted to daylight savings time settings and will set all the clocks ahead by 1 hour, giving you a 60 minute window where no one expects the vault to be able to be opened. Your second duty involves hacking into the CCTV system in the Casino to shut down cameras along your planned escape route.",
