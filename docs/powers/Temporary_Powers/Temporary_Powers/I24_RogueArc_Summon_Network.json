He rewarded you with an opportunity to call him on an untraceable, discardable cell-phone, which will summon him to assist you in battle for 5 minutes. You can only have one cell-phone number for Network at a time. You must be level 30 or higher for him to take your call. If you become a villain or a reinforced villain, he will not answer your call until you switch to at least a neutral alignment. If you have already summoned Colleague or Second Measure, you will not be able to summon Network until they depart. Recharge: Long",
