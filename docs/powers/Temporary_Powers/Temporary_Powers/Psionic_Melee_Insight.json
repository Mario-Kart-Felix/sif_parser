  "display_help": "While you have Insight Mental Strike, Psi Blade, Telekinetic Blow, Psi Blade Sweep and Mass Levitate will cause additional psionic damage over time. Additionally, Psionic Melee powers with control effects like Boggle and Psi Blade Sweep and Greater Psi Blade have these effects empowered. Using Greater Psi Blade while you have Insight will both cause this power to deal significantly more damage and cause a greater hold effect, but will remove Insight from you. When Insight wears off you will not be able to gain Insight again for a short time.",
