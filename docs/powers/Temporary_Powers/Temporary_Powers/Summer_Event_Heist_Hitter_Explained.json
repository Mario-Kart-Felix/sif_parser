This will provide easier access for the Thief when they attempt their infiltration. During your escape, your team must not be recognized by the casino's facial recognition software, so your second duty involves finding a random person to teach how to count cards in blackjack in order to trick the software into trying to identify them, not your team. The quality of your choice will determine how long the system is occupied by the process, giving your team a small reprieve.",
