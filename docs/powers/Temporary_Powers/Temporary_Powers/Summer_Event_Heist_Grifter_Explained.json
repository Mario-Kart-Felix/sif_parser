This will keep her out of the upstairs office, where the Thief will simultaneously be searching for objects crucial to your operation. Your second task will be to secure the voice-passphrase for the vault from Mr. Dubois himself, by coaxing him into saying key words that can be used to assemble the phrase. Your success will unlock the Vault for the Thief.",
