In keeping with his club's theme it must be given to someone else to be effective and giving it to a Villain, Rogue, or Loyalist increases their potential to near god-like proportions! This version of Dimension Drop Heals the target and recovers their Endurance. Dimension Drop can only be used on teammates. You have 4 charges. Recharge: Slow",
