The Dire Wolf has good defense to Melee, Ranged and AoE attacks and good resistance to Cold damage. You may only have 1 Dire Wolf under your control at any given time. If you attempt to summon another Dire Wolf the power will fail. Dire Wolf attacks have a chance to build a charge of Pack Mentality. Pack Mentality is a Damage buff aura that radiates from the Mastermind and can stack up to 10 times. Recharge: Very Long",
