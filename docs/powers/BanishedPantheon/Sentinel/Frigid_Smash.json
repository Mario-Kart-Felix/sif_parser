  "display_help": "You wind up a massive smash, striking the ground with tremendous force. This unleashes a shock wave of death energy in a cone which causes cold damage, with the lingering effect of death also dealing negative energy damage over time. Additionally, the target's defense against and resistance to cold and negative energy attacks are reduced. Finally, the longer the Sentinel remains alive, the more likely his presence will sap the target's soul, causing them to suffer increased endurance cost for all powers.",
