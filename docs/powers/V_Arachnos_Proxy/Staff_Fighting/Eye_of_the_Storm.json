While a form is active, this power will build one level of Perfection if the user has two or less levels, if the user has three levels of Perfection it will consume them and gain some benefit. 3 Levels of Perfection of Body will cause additional smashing damage and reduce damage resistance slightly for a short time. 3 Levels of Perfection of Mind will cause additional psionic damage and reduce attack and movement speed for a short time. 3 Levels of Perfection of Soul will cause additional energy damage and reduce defense for a short time. Critical Hit damage isn't enhanced by levels of Perfection. Damage: Moderate, Recharge: Long",
