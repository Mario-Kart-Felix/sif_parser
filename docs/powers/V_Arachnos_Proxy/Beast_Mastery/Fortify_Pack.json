The number of charges of Pack Mentality you own when activating this power will determine the potency of the Defense and Regeneration buff that will be granted to your pack. Additionally, simply owning this power grants your beast pets attacks a chance to critically hit that scales with the amount of Pack Mentality owned by the Mastermind. Recharge: Very Long",
