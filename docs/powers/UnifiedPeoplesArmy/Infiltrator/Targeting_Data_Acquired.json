  "display_help": "You update the targeting information available to all nearby allies, improving their chance to hit. Attack speed is also increased, as the more accurate information means your allies spend less time needing to prepare their attacks. Though targeting information is updated every 30 seconds, the most current update is only accurate for a portion of the time between updates, so this bonus will fall off before the next update can occur.",
