The more foes nearby, the more life is restored to you. Drained foes are left Disoriented. The dark effects of this Soul Transfer will actually leave you invulnerable for a brief time, and protected from XP Debt for 60 seconds. There must be at least one foe nearby to fuel the Transfer and revive yourself. Damage: Moderate, Recharge: Very Long",
