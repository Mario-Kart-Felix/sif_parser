Foes may also be drained of some endurance, and some of that endurance may be transferred to nearby allies. Any attack will interrupt the effect temporarily and foes will re-gain control, although their movement and attack rates will be reduced. This effect can last for some time, and will continue to paralyze foes in the field. Recharge: Slow",
