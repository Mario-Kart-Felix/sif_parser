Perhaps it was even a Necromancer. Now it only hungers for the souls of the living, and is quite good at feeding itself. The Lich specializes in dark control and draining powers. You may only have 1 Lich under your control at any given time. If you attempt to summon another Lich, the power will fail. Recharge: Very Long",
