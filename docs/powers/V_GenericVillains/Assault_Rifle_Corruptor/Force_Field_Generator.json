The Dispersion Bubble also protects allies from Immobilization, Disorient, and Hold effects. The Done will follow you and can be buffed and healed or even destroyed like any friendly entity. However, the Drone is not a Henchman and cannot be given commands. You can only ever have one Force Field Generator. Recharge: Very Slow",
